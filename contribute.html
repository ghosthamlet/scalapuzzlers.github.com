  <h2>How to contribute</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Fork our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/scalapuzzlers/scalapuzzlers.github.com">github repo</a></li>
    <li>
      In <code>puzzlers</code> directory, you will find a file called <code>_template.html</code>. It contains the yaml syntax expected by the <code>_layout/puzzler.html</code>.
      Make a copy of the <code>_empty_template.html</code> so you can start from scratch.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you are done, rename it following the naming convention: <code>pzzlr-???.html</code>. The three digit puzzler number should be the next increment of the latest puzzler in the repository. You might need to check the open <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/scalapuzzlers/scalapuzzlers.github.com/pulls">pull requests</a> to ensure the number is not already taken.
    </li>
    <li>
      Commit and push your puzzler HTML file (not the template) to github. Then issue a pull request. That's it! 
    </li>
  </ol>
