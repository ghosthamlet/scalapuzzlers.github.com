      <h1>A fun way to learn more about <img src="img/scala-logo.png" alt="Scala"/></h1>
      <p>Welcome to Scala Puzzlers, the collection of <em>Traps, Pitfalls and Corner Cases</em> in the Scala language.</p>
      <p>Prepare to be surprised, entertained and...well, puzzled! What is presented here is a selection of seemingly simple examples which demonstrate that there's plenty of head-scratching left in Scala. Let your mind be challenged by unexpected and unintuitive behaviour and results and learn something in the process.   </p>
      <p>Choose a puzzler from the left-hand list to get started!</p>
