  def sumSizes(collections: Iterable[TraversableOnce[_]]): Int ={
    collections.map(_.size).sum
  }
  println(sumSizes(List(Set(1, 2), List(3, 4))))
  println(sumSizes(Set(List(1, 2), Set(3, 4))))

  d:

      2
solution: b
explanation: |
  Even though collections.map would appear to map an iterable to 
  another "nice" iterable, since the Collections Redesign the type of 
  the returned iterable will (usually) match the input type. Which, for 
  sets, means...no duplicates.
  And yes, foldLeft would obviously be a much nicer way to do this <img src="img/smiley.jpg" alt=":)"/>
