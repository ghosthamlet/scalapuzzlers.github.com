explanation: |
  <p>
    The definitions of the values <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> are valid and compile without an error. 
    As the definitions are recursive, 
    the type of the declared values has to be provided (SLS, section 4.1).
  </p>
  <p>
    In Scala, object fields are preinitialized to their default value, and for the type <code>String</code> 
    (and all other reference types) the default value is <code>null</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is as in Java.
    However, such a recursive definition of a field in a Java class body gives an <code>illegal forward reference</code> 
    compiler error,
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  class Z {
     String s = s + s;
  }
    </pre>
    but the following compiles fine.
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  class Z {
     String s = this.s + this.s;
  }
    </pre>
    This demonstrates, that the checking which is done by the Java compiler is quite shallow.
    The Scala way to accept recursive definitions for all situations is more consistent.   
  </p>
  <p>
    What remains to explain is the result of this puzzler.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Value <code>s1</code> is initialized to <code>null</code>, therefore the expression <code>s1.length</code>
        ends in a <code>NullPointerException</code> at run-time.
      </li>  
      <li>
        The initialization of the value <code>s2</code> actually gets translated to 
        byte code equvalent to
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
  s2 = (new StringBuilder()).append(s2).append(s2).toString()
        </pre>
        where the argument <code>s2</code> has its default value <code>null</code>. According to the
        <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/expressions.html#15.18.1.1">JLS, Section 15.18.1.1</a>
        the reference <code>null</code> is converted to the string <code>"null"</code>, and the value which gets assigned to <code>s2</code>
        is the string <code>"nullnull"</code> which has length 8.
    </ul>
  </p>
