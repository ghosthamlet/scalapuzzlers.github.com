  object XY {

      val value: Int = X.value + 1

  print(if(math.random > 0.5) XY.X.value else XY.Y.value)

possibleSolutions:
  a: 
    text: Always prints 1
  b:
    text: Always prints 2
  c:
    text: Nondeterministically prints either
  d:
    text: 1 or 2
  e:
    text: Fails with a compilation error.
solution: b
explanation: |
  The recursive definition of the two fields <code>X.value</code> and <code>Y.value</code> is valid and does compile, but as it is recursive, the type (<code>Int</code>) has to be specified for at least <code>X.value</code>.
  <p>
  When either object <code>X</code> or <code>Y</code> is accessed, then its field <code>value</code> is initialized (objects are not initialized until they are accessed). If object <code>X</code> is initialized first, then the initialization of its field <code>value</code> triggers the initialization of object <code>Y</code>. In order to initialize the field <code>Y.value</code>, the field <code>X.value</code> is accessed. The VM takes notice that the initialization of object <code>X</code> is already running and returns the current value of <code>X.value</code> which is zero (the default value for <code>Int</code> fields), so no stack overflow at runtime. As a consequence <code>Y.value</code> is set to <code>0+1=1</code> and <code>X.value</code> to <code>1+1=2</code>. However, if object <code>Y</code> is initialized first, then <code>Y.value</code> is initialized with <code>2</code> and <code>X.value</code> with <code>1</code>.
  <p>
  In the <code>if</code>-statement we either access <code>X.value</code> or <code>Y.value</code> and force the initialization of either <code>X</code> or <code>Y</code>. But as we have seen above, which ever object is accessed first, its field <code>value</code> is initialized to <code>2</code>, therefore the result of the conditional statement is <em>always</em> <code>2</code>.
