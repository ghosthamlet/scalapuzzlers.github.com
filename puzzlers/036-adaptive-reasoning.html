solution: b
explanation: |
  <p>
    The <tt>message</tt> parameter to the <tt>print</tt> routine is call-by-name. 
    The argument is not evaluated until it is used, and it is evaluated each time it is called.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the curly braces after the invocation of <tt>new Printer</tt> is not a call-by-name
    parameter. It's a class body. Although the intention was to supply <tt>prompt</tt> as
    the <tt>prompter</tt> for the <tt>Printer</tt>, in fact <tt>prompt</tt> is called in the
    constructor of an anonymous subclass.
  </p>
  <p>
    How could this be? Constructors always have a parameter list, and if no arguments are
    provided for the application, then an empty argument list is supplied (SLS 5.1.1).
    Since the parameter to the constructor is of type <tt>Unit</tt>, the compiler is willing
    to adapt the empty argument list to an empty tuple, the <tt>Unit</tt> value.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adapting an argument list so that it is taken as a single <tt>Tuple</tt> argument is usually helpful.
    In this case, under <tt>-Ywarn-adapted-args</tt>, the compiler will warn: "this is unlikely
    to be what you want." The feature can be disabled with <tt>-Yno-adapted-args</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The desired behavior was, presumably, for the prompt to be evaluated only when the <tt>prompted</tt>
    parameter is <tt>true</tt>, which can be achieved by the construction:
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  scala> new Printer(prompt) print (message = "Puzzled yet?", prompted = true)
  puzzler$ Puzzled yet?

  scala> new Printer(prompt) print (message = "Puzzled yet?")
  Puzzled yet?
    </pre>
  </p>
