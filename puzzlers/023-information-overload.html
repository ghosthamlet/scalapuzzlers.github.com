explanation: |
  <p>
    If the method <code>Overload.foo(x)</code> is invoked, then overload resolution (SLS Section 6.26.3) comes into play. Both alternatives <code>foo(Any)</code> and <code>foo(x.type)</code> are potentiall applicable candidates (based on the shape of the arguments). As a next step in overload resolution, the argument <code>x</code> is typed <em>without</em> an expected type and is checked against each candidate method for applicability. The type of the argument <code>x</code> is <code>X</code> (and not <code>x.type</code>) and therefore only the method <code>foo(arg: Any)</code> remains as alternative and is chosen. This explains, why <code>Overload.foo(arg: Any)</code> returns <code>1</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a path <code>y</code> has singleton type <code>x.type</code>, then <code>x.type</code> and <code>y.type</code> are equivalent, i.e. they are interchangeable in all contexts (SLS Section 3.5.1). When <code>Overload.foo(y : y.type)</code> is invoked, then typing the argument results in <code>y.type</code>, and this type is compatible with the parameter type <code>x.type</code> and this variant is applicable. From the two remaining candidates in overload resolution the most specific alternative is chosen, and this is <code>foo(x.type)</code>.
  </p>
  Interesting: in the non-overloaded case the argument <code>x</code> is with the parameter type <code>x.type</code> as expected type. This typing succeeds and therefore the method is applicable to the argument <code>x</code> without an explicit type ascription:
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  scala> def bar(arg: x.type) = 3
  bar: (arg: x.type)Int

  scala> bar(x)
  res1: Int = 3
  </pre>
