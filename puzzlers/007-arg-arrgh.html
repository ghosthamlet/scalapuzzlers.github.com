  def square[T : Numeric](n: T) = implicitly[Numeric[T]].times(n, n)

  def twiceA[T](f: T => T, a: T) = f(f(a))
  def twiceB[T](f: T => T)(a: T) = f(f(a))
  def twiceC[T](a: T, f: T => T) = f(f(a))
  def twiceD[T](a: T)(f: T => T) = f(f(a))

  twiceA(square, 2)
  twiceB(square)(2)
  twiceC(2, square)
  twiceD(2)(square)
possibleSolutions:
  a:
    text: The first, second and third fail with compilation errors, the fourth prints
    code: Int = 16
  b:
    text: All four fail with compilation errors
  c:
    text: The second and fourth fail with compilation errors, the first and third print
    code: |
      Int = 16
      Int = 16
  d:
    text: Prints
    code: |
      Int = 16
      Int = 16
      Int = 16
      Int = 16
solution: a
explanation: |
  For <tt>square</tt> to be applicable as an argument, the compiler has to know that <tt>T</tt> is bound to (a type that can implicitly be converted to) a Numeric. Even though it would appear that 2, as an Int, obviously fulfills this  condition, that information is not available to the compiler in a multi-arg list. Only in the fourth version is <tt>T</tt> bound "sufficiently early" for <tt>square</tt> to be allowed.
