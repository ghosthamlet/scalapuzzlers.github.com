  <p>
    In Scala, the "or else" idioms, such as <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Option" target="_blank"><tt>Option.orElse</tt></a>, <tt>Option.getOrElse</tt>, <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.util.Try" target="_blank"><tt>Try.recover</tt></a> and <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.concurrent.Future" target="_blank"><tt>Future.recover</tt></a>, are defined to accept a wider type than you start with:
  </p>
  <p>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  def getOrElse[B >: A](default: => B): B
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don't supply a value of the type it wants, it will take whatever it can, including <tt>Any</tt> thing at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, <tt>Any</tt> is inferred for <tt>B</tt>, and there is no type error to show that an <tt>Int</tt> was used as an alternative for a pair of <tt>Ints</tt>. In the absence of a type on the pattern definition, the pattern match throws a MatchError at runtime:
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  scala> val (x, y) = (List(1,3,5), List(2,4,6)).zipped find (_._1 > 10) getOrElse (10)
  scala.MatchError: 10 (of class java.lang.Integer)
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Even without a mistaken change in arity, similar errors are possible with swapped elements:
  </p>
  <p>
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  def howToPronounce(numAndName: Option[(Int, String)]) = {
    val (num, name) = numAndName getOrElse ("eight", 8)
    println(s"The word for $num is '$name'")
  }
  howToPronounce(Some((7, "seven")))
  howToPronounce(None)
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since <tt>orElse</tt> often represents a default value that is typically not exercised in normal usage,
    the correctness of this branch of the code path should be checked by testing.
    And that's why we have code coverage tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ways to avoid this issue include:
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  val (num, name): (Int, String) = Some((7, "seven")) getOrElse Pair("eight", 8)
  <console>:10: error: type mismatch;
   found   : String("eight")
   required: Int
         val (num, name): (Int, String) = Some((7, "seven")) getOrElse Pair("eight", 8)
                                                                            ^
  <console>:10: error: type mismatch;
   found   : Int(8)
   required: String
         val (num, name): (Int, String) = Some((7, "seven")) getOrElse Pair("eight", 8)
                                                                                     ^
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Or using a method that eliminates the inferred type:
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  implicit class OptionSafe[A](val opt: Option[A]) {
    def getOrElseSafe(default: => A): A = opt getOrElse default
  }
  val (num, name) = Some((7, "seven")) getOrElseSafe Pair("eight", 8)
  <console>:16: error: type mismatch;
   found   : String("eight")
   required: Int
           val (num, name) = Some((7, "seven")) getOrElseSafe Pair("eight", 8)
                                                                   ^
  </pre>
  </p>
