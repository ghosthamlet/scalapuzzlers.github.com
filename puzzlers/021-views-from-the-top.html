puzzleNote: |
  Note: This example cannot <a href="https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5299">currently</a> be run from the REPL (as it contains a package definition).
  Copy the sample into a file and compile with <code>scalac</code>.
puzzle: |
  object base {
    class X { val context = "object base" }
  }

  package base {
    class Y { val context = "package base" }
  }

  object Main extends App {
    println((new base.X).context)
    println((new base.Y).context)
  }
possibleSolutions:
  a: 
    text: Fails with the compile-time error
    code: |
      error: base is already defined as object base
      package base {
              ^
  b:
    text: Fails with the compile-time error
    code: |
      error: type X is not a member of package base
      println((new base.X).context)
                        ^
  c:
    code: |
      error: type Y is not a member of object base
      println((new base.Y).context)
                        ^
  d:
    code: |
      object base
      package base
solution: c
explanation: |
  <p>
    According to the SLS (Section 9.2) it is illegal to have a package with the same fully qualified name as a module or a class.
    For example, on the following compilation unit
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  package com.scalapuzzlers
  object base { class X }
  package base { class X }
    </pre>
    the compiler will report an error:
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  X.scala:3: error: base is already defined as object base
  package base { class X }
          ^
  one error found
    </pre>
    Top-level definitions outside a packaging however are assumed to be injected into a special empty package.
    That package can neither be named nor imported, but the members of the empty package are visible to each other
    without qualification.
  </p>
  <p>
    The example above defines the package <code>base</code> and the top-level object <code>&lt;empty&gt;.base</code>, where the latter 
    is visible without qualification, i.e. the object shadows the package.
    Thus the first <code>println</code> statement would compile fine and print
    <code>object base</code>.
    The access to <code>base.Y</code> in the second <code>println</code> statement leads to the compiler error
    <code>type Y is not a member of object base</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Class <code>Y</code> in package <code>base</code> can be accessed
    with a full qualified identifier:
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  println((new _root_.base.Y).context)
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Members of the empty package are however only visible from within the empty package, i.e. only from
    other top-level classes. In all other packages, top-level objects and classes are not accessible.
    Real projects will thus never use top-level classes.
  </p>
