  trait A {
    val foo: Int
    val bar = 10
    println("In A: foo: " + foo + ", bar: " + bar)
  }

  class B extends A {
    val foo: Int = 25
    println("In B: foo: " + foo + ", bar: " + bar)
  }

  class C extends B {
    override val bar = 99
    println("In C: foo: " + foo + ", bar: " + bar)
  }

  new C
possibleSolutions:
  a: 
    code: |
      In A: foo: 0, bar: 0
      In B: foo: 25, bar: 0
      In C: foo: 25, bar: 99
  b:
    code: |
      In A: foo: 0, bar: 10
      In B: foo: 25, bar: 10
      In C: foo: 25, bar: 99
  c:
    text: c
    code: |
      In A: foo: 0, bar: 0
      In B: foo: 25, bar: 99
      In C: foo: 25, bar: 99
  d:
    text: d
    code: |
      In A: foo: 25, bar: 99
      In B: foo: 25, bar: 99
      In C: foo: 25, bar: 99
solution: a
explanation: |
  Notice that bar is a val that is overridden in C. The Scala compiler 
  will only initialize vals once, so since bar will be initialized in C it is 
  not initialized before that time and appears as its default value (0, 
  in this case) during the construction of the superclass.
