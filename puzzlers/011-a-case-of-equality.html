explanation: |
  The first two expressions (<code>c1 == c2</code> and <code>c1.## == c2.##</code>)
  both return <code>false</code> (as given). The two instances of class <code>C</code>
  are different, therefore both <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> return
  different results.
  </p><p>
  For case classes however, the <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code> and
  <code>toString</code> methods are generated, and for two instances of a case
  class with the same elements, we could expect that both  <code>equals</code> and
  <code>hashCode</code> return the same result (i.e. Answer 4).
  </p><p>
  According to the SLS (section 5.3.2) however, a case class implicitly
  overrides the methods <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code> and
  <code>toString</code> of class <code>scala.AnyRef</code> <em>only</em> if the case class
  itself does not provide a definition for one of these methods and <em>only</em> if
  a concrete definition is not given in some base class of the case class
  (except <code>AnyRef</code>).
  </p><p>
  In our example, the base trait <code>OverridesEquals</code> provides an <code>equals</code>
  method, so the case class does not provide its own definition and the
  comparison of two different instances returns <code>false</code>.
  </p><p>
  For method <code>hashCode</code> however no implementation is provided, neither
  in class <code>CC</code> nor in some base class, so here the implicitly overridden version
  is used which returns the same value for equal elements.
