  val ij: (Int, Int) = ("3", "4")
  val (i, j): (Int, Int) = ("3", "4")
possibleSolutions:

    text: Prints
    code: |
      ij: (3, 4)
      i: 3
      j: 4
  b:
    text: Both fail with compilation exceptions
  c:
    text: Both fail with runtime exceptions
  d:
    text: The first one fails with a compilation exception and the second one fails with a runtime exception
solution: c
explanation: |
  The former is an assignment of a tuple which is not type correct. 
  The latter is a pattern match which for which type information is 
  erased, so it will compile (with a warning) but fail at runtime.
