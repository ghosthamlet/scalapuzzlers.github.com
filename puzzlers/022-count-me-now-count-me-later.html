explanation: |
  <p>
    <code>f(a) _</code> and <code>f(a)(_)</code> have different meanings, governed by
    different sections of the Scala language specification.
    </p>
    <p>
    <code>f(a)(_)</code> is the placeholder syntax for anonymous functions,
    described in SLS 6.23.  Evaluation is deferred.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>f(a) _</code> is eta expansion, described in SLS 6.26.5.
    Arguments given are evaluated eagerly; only the method call itself
    is deferred.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example, the eta expansion in
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  val adder2 = add(counter) _
    </pre>
    causes eager evaluation, as described: as soon as that line is run, Scala actually evaluates counter and binds <code>1</code>, the result, to the <code>counter</code> argument for <code>adder2</code>. Hence <code>x</code> is <code>1</code> when first printed.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>adder1</code>, on the other hand, is an anonymous function, so its <code>counter</code> argument is only bound when <code>adder1</code> is evaluated. Since <code>x</code> is already <code>1</code> at this point, <code>counter</code> will be <code>2</code> and the evaluation of <code>adder1</code> prints <code>12</code>. The value of <code>x</code> is now <code>2</code>, as indicated by the program's output.
  </p>
