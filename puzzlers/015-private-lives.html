  object Lives {

    }

    object Private {

      private class C2 {}
    }
  }
possibleSolutions:
  a: 
    text: Compiles without error.
  b:
    text: The compiler reports an error on the implementation of method <code>foo1</code>.
  c:
    text: The compiler reports an error on the implementation of method <code>foo2</code>.
  d:
    text: The compiler reports an error on the implementation of both methods <code>foo1</code> and <code>foo2</code>.
solution: b
explanation: |
  <p>
    Object <code>Private</code> defines two classes <code>C1</code> and <code>C2</code>.
    <code>C2</code> is a private class which is only accessible in object <code>Private</code> and its companion class, 
    whereas <code>C1</code> is a public class with a private default constructor, so this class can only be 
    instantiated within class <code>C1</code>.
    </p><p>
    As a consequence, method <code>foo2</code> just compiles fine (as the private class <code>C2</code> is visible in
    class <code>Private</code>), whereas the implementation of method <code>foo1</code> reports the following compiler error:
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  error: constructor C1 in class C1 cannot be accessed in class Private
           def foo1: Any = new Private.C1
                           ^
  </pre>
      </p><p>
    Note, that the result type of method <code>foo2</code> has to be set to a base type of <code>Private.C2</code>, 
    otherwise the result type of this method would be a type which is invisible by any caller outside of 
    class/object <code>Private</code> (the compiler would report that the private class <code>C2</code> escapes its defining scope).
    For method <code>foo1</code> this is not necessary.
    </p>
