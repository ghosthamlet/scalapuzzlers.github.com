      The first invocation of <code>invert3</code> fails with a compilation error, and the second prints

      The second invocation of <code>invert3</code> fails with a compilation error, and the first prints
    code: 2, 2, 3
  d:
    text: |
      Both invocation of <code>invert3</code> fail with a compilation error.
solution: b
explanation: |
  <p>
    The type of <code>invert3</code> after eta-expansion (SLS, section 6.26.5) is no longer a method but a function object, i.e. an instance of <code>Function2[Int, Int, Unit]</code>. This is also reported by the REPL
    <pre class""prettyprint lang-scala">
  scala> def invert3 = invert(3) _
  invert3: (Int, Int) => Unit
    </pre>
    This function object has an <code>apply</code> method (inherited from <code>Function2[T1, T2, R]</code>) with the following signature:
    <pre class""prettyprint lang-scala">
      def apply(v1: T1, v2: T2): R
    </pre>
    In particular, this method defines <em>no</em> default values for its arguments!
    As a consequence, <code>invert3(v1 = 2)</code> leads to a compile time error (as there are not enough actual arguments for method <code>apply</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
    The argument names <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> are the names as they are defined in the <code>apply</code>-method of <code>Function2[T1, T2, R]</code>.
    The argument names of <code>apply</code>-method of <em>every</em> function with two arguments are named <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code>, in particular
    these names are by no means related to the argument names of method <code>invert3</code>. Method <code>invert3</code> has by chance arguments
    with the same names, but unfortunately in a different order.
    <code>invert3(v1 = 2, v2 = 1)</code> prints <code>1, 2, 3</code> as the parameter <code>v1</code> (which corresponds to the parameter
    <code>v2</code> in method <code>invert</code>) is set to <code>2</code> and parameter <code>v2</code> (which corresponds to the parameter
    <code>v1</code> in method <code>invert</code>) is set to <code>1</code>.
  </p>
