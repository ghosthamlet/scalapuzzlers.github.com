puzzle: |
  var IJ: (Int, Int) = (3, 4)
  println(IJ)
  var (I, J): (Int, Int) = (3, 4)
  println(I)
  println(J)
possibleSolutions:
  a: 
    text: Prints
    code: |
      (3, 4)
      3
      4
  b:
    text: Both fail with compilation exceptions
  c:
    text: The first one succeeds and prints
    code: |
      (3, 4)
    text2: and the second one fails with a compilation exception
  d:
    text: The first one succeeds and prints
    code: |
      (3, 4)
    text2: and the second one fails with a runtime exception
solution: c
explanation: |
  The former is an assignment of a tuple which is type correct. The 
  latter tries to match (3, 4) against two constants I and J â€“ Scala 
  assumes that UPPERCASE variables in pattern matches are constants.
