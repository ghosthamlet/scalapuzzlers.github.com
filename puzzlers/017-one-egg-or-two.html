explanation: |
  According to the SLS (section 4.1), a value definition <code>val p1, . . . , pn : T = e</code> is a shorthand for the sequence of value definitions <code>val p1 : T = e; ...; val pn : T = e</code>. 
  This means that in our example the expression <code>new C</code> is evaluated twice
  and therefore <code>x1 == x2</code> is <code>false</code>.
  </p><p>
  The second value definition is a pattern binder which is defined in section 8.1.3 of the SLS.
  A pattern binder <code>x@p</code> consists of a pattern variable <code>x</code> and a pattern <code>p</code>.
  In our case the pattern <code>p</code> is a variable pattern which matches any value and binds
  the variable name (in our case <code>y2</code>) to that value. The pattern binder binds that 
  value also to the pattern variable <code>y1</code>. 
  As the same value is bound to both variables <code>y1</code> and <code>y2</code>,
  the expression <code>y1 == y2</code> is <code>true</code>.
