possibleSolutions:
  a: 
    text: Prints
    code: |
      I X C M
      C I M X

      I X C M
  d:
    text: Prints
    code: |
      M C I X
      C M I X
solution: a
explanation: |
  <p>
    Since <tt>RomanNumeral</tt>s are ordered by their values, iterating over the sorted set of <tt>numerals</tt> will return them in that order and result in the representations being printed according to the <strong>value</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mapping the numerals to their <em>representation</em> will result in a sorted set of <tt>String</tt>s which, naturally enough, will be ordered lexicographically. Iterating over them will thus return them in that order.
  </p>
  <p>
    The potentially unexpected reordering of the items in the iterable could have been prevented by, for example,
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  numerals.view.map(_.representation).foreach { ... }
    </pre>
    or
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-scala">
  numerals.toSeq.map(_.representation).foreach { ... }
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the initial declaration order of the set does not have any effect on the iteration order. Also, note that, of course, the code sample using <tt>map</tt> inefficiently iterates over <tt>numerals</tt> <strong>twice</strong>.
  </p>
